Dutch Medicine Dog Token (DMDT)


White Paper


Why DMDT:

The inspiration came from the Dutch culture how the world sees us. 
Every time when we go on vacation and say we are from the Netherlands people get a picture-perfect image of “our” country in their mind.
Unfortunately, is this image driven by drugs, coffeeshops, flowers, windmills, cheese, and of course our red-light districts.
Not all the above are that bad to be linked with but there are so much more then only these typical things.

That’s why we came up with the idea to impress the world with our very own NFT collection.
The cartoon version of how the world sees the Netherlands. With our famous Bulldog as star in the middle.

We now want to link our inspiration into the Crypto world and set up a community driven meme token running on the Stellar lumens chain .

The NFT’s are currently running on Ethereum Network (ERC20)
we are also adding the Stellar Blockchain to gain a bigger public.

This token is running on the stellar network, the token is built to link all our Future projects in the WEB3 area and keep the fees and network cost as low as possible.
We are currently running our own NFT Collections on Opensea and want to expand our community and Socials by stepping into the world of crypto.
Our NFT collection will also come for 50% into the stellar network and will be running on Litemint.io .

The choice for stellar came from the high fees on different platforms.
fees on stellar are approximately 0.0001$ Also with a transaction time of “about instant” Stellar Lumens is one of the fastest and eco friendly Blockchains at this moment.

Future Ideas:

In the future we want to link more of our community together and expand the socials into a larger network. The Idea we’re working on is completely driven by the new Meta verse and WEB3

Ideas we are currently working on are things such as building a website, Gaming app, Mobile App, and much more.

Also, when the token is live and up and running
We want to host some Airdrops for our token.
Giveaways for our NFT’s.

Cause our NFT’s and token are the symbol of a dog we want to search for a good place in the Netherlands where we can negotiate about some donations.
Where real shelter dogs are getting the chance of a second life.
We are working at this part now. We want to give these dogs the chance for a better home.
The GOLDEN place where they can live their happiest life’s! 
Even for the dogs that never can be adopted again we want to give them a special feeling and the best memories.
(ASAP we want to bring this to you)

Stay tuned for the latest updates!
